# Started Jan 2022 though original idea was used in 2014 as a CGI remote web interface control for outdoor music
# Lots of thanks to Bash Hackers for an awesome website and tips.
# Lots of thanks to SomaFM for streaming the best stuff on this side of the universe.
# Plays random playlist streams from a variable set in the script.
# Uses mpg123 binary as the backend.
# Uses alsa mixer for volume control.

# To run, open your favorite terminal and just type: bash ./music_thingy.bash
# No need to make it executable. That way you can click it open with your
# favorite text editor. ;-)

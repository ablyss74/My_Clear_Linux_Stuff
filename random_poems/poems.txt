Between heaven and hell,
Is a place worthy of a tale,
More surreal in character,
A picture for the painter,
Albeit, a bit less prettier,
For some kind hearts will fashion,
Dreary tales of classless action,
While some clamer to higher order,
Bribing their way amongst dear professor,
But a cleaner home no doubt,
Is but a few heart beats about,
Where a heart is always home,
To this I toast and bring many alone,
And gather in tomorrow that entails,
For this is home, a place worthy of a tale.

Shackled to this stone that pulls me,
Down into an endless tumbling roll,
Where time just echos,
Of things tangible but hollow,
Like a book with no pages,
A world with no faces,
Just a tumbling stone,


%

Order and Chaos how you are,
Stars shine, even flows are intwinned,
Like the mastery of this frozen triad,
Beastly canvases blind the horizon,
Oh, what better cup to light from?
A poor humble servant caught in the storm,
Blood stained shoes refrained views,
Oh, what a sorry fell‚Äôr in the shame,
Darken by color only passing rain,
Frozen inside a hollow space,
Not a chance in a prize race,
Vanity! -- Naught higher a vision or two,
Back between the hours of lost mediocre.


%

Dark passages for the chosen star,
Adrift in a mighty fashioned quasar,
Visioning tunnels lost in a sound,
God‚Äôs hand reaches out on demand,
Between the heavens a place called home,
A tale of night and day cast in a glass dome,
Broken but revived to take another chance,
A sparkle to a little dipper,
Stretched out to shimmer,
Heavens that bring little angels,
Vast to change the clouds that tangle,
Brimming the poor beggars pocket full,
Of wood chips and toy ships,
Ready to sell.

Cheat thy death stick to what is pure,
Linger a while in the moonlight for sure,
The day will come where bees fly no more,
And spring out in ruins that bore,
A sacred title for the lore,
Under high waves of summer-- Lost !
Beget a child in a thunderous puzzle of love,
Where high prices are sure to divide,
But looked twice and find a conquering stride,
Forget her name -- that drink gone to wine,
Friends never thirst, in the shadows of a curse,
Forgiving is a game, for some lamer onboard will claim,
Each has a sum for partaking the loot,
Scouting through the forest if sorrow suits,
Victory for them in groups, to pursue the merry,
Which bare sweet gems of red and cherry.

On passing rays that govern the days,
Let up on thy rue, t‚Äôwas a passing clue,
Vexed bonds and squirrely throngs,
O‚Äôerly packed dens of children and a song to whim,
About a crime in a passing sign,
Pinned on the wall, bricked and collared up,
Ready to play in the grand old cup,
Zimmering a frown for the few who knew to say,
Easy does it, else you might pay!

Cumbersome cry out in remark of your book,
The night comes before you, so give it a look,
Cry out in selfish winds that afterwhile go silent,
Before time once listened prefects even glisten,
But never a second lost in sands that have taken frost,
In other worldly mothers voices that bring a reward,
A catalyst for the sinner who bothered no one,
Only to bring the rain on a river that flows to sum,
A reward for death--- Not a beacon of hope,
In efforts lost but reinvented, kind love from a Pope,
Not a beacon of hope sways in, but cast all sin.

Oh light above, 
Give us this day of fruits and veggies,
Like a banana or a bowl of nuts and tasties,
Yes the belly fat must go! 
It‚Äôs a deadly fact it hurts my back!

Why do we say things we do,
To be in love with you,
Would be a dream come true.
Sonnets under my bed,
Thoughts of you in my head,
Neither would be as heavenly.
Bliss an' silky as the snow,
As our love is purer
Than gold.

The real definition of eye candy
I put the love in your heart,
Not in a picture of me, or you.
I would be more happy walking with strangers,
And to see the face anew,
Where love is kind,
And always sublime.
But if one day I could,
Dream adifferent,
I'd wish me up a steamy bowl,
Of ice cream melting in the sun again,
Next to you.

Awake to dream in a thought but
Was he who dreamt for her while she walked
The teacher preacher said over yonder
Keep them pockets full of dollars
But ya, when the chime ticks and
The time whistles without a clock
Men become birds of flight in
Dreams she paints in the night,
And women become men in delight,
And Angels far away may bless this day.

  In  dusty bundles  of hemp intwinned
Tucked  intwixted those  mystery sounds

They are in a safer place
Where childern dream of stepping stones
And buried treasure tis a heart of gold.

Until Jack is fed on the right dinner plate

  Bluee and tall with a rice paddiee beside her
Her timeless smile and golden heart

She's won many and trails she knows

            Already mapped the cosmos,

            And clocked it in 

                    Temples and Shrines.



                    Not a camera nor 

            Fancy telescope did they need,

            Nor rocket nor quantum computer

                    With super sonic speed.



                    Are we really aiming in 

            The right direction?

            Where oh where do we really see?

Word pRon
A midnite quest,
To unveil a staggering lisp,
Quietly, patiently, too sudden a tongue,
In a race to freedom from thwarty barons,
Outside, tho'art many cannons,
Waiting, loudly and screaming, 
Boom!
And then came nothing,
A silence cold and quick,
Not another,
Willing to,
Shine.
A frozen castle,
Dazzle and craddle the twilight,
Whilest the mouse owned the lot,
Bringing a sense of righteousness. 
This was the epic journey of reliving,
Sensible hero's, -- gods in winters clothes,
Only concerned with getting closer to home,
The heart.

A child sits on the hill top,
Gazes into the perplexity of single mountain in his hands,

COMPASS 
Sometimes I'm sweet,
Sometimes I'm sour,
Sometimes I see the sun, sometimes it showers.
Sometimes I'm here, in a story far intwined,
Or in the silent reflections caught in my mind,
A memory to share, for those things we give care,
Mixed in with the love I hold so dear.

Ah, true love,
There is the rub,
Another point to dot, and a line to cross,

And the sun whom shines,
A part in a sea, to calm or devoir,
Which fate is truly ours?

~To Care or Not to Care~
To care or not to care,

Or the pur of the Dragons whos flame Aye suffer,
Might this Care be spoken in words that last for a wee bit for those who gave more, yet take it less.

The finish line is not in sight.

That holds the cup of memory, I share now in grace,
Thou this is not who I am, said some imaginary friend,
And so the page was left unturned -- as the sun burned.

Food for Nous
Imagine a future you,
And many others too,
Could travel back in time,
To fix their own kind,
But the old you disappeared,
Hooked up to a machine,
Where only the conscious remains.
This seems so grim, so cold,
Like bad dream that has no end,
Nor story to unfold.
So perhaps a better path lies ahead,
Turning the grim cold to shiny stone,
Like a cats eyes burning in desire,
Or a hawk unfolding her wings to sore higher,
T'is the mystery, if all were true,
Why our eyes hide us from the who,
Or what we really are.

Little bird, high in the sky,
Why is it you sing a lullaby,
And tears come from your eyes?
Mr. Frog, deep in the murk,

Little lady bug, so small and frail,
Why do you land on my arm? What do you see?
All these creatures so dandy, so fine,
All worth more than a glass of red wine?

Man wrote of the fire that scorched the earth,
In ballistic song and mankind‚Äôs wrongs,
Erewhile the heavens bore the truth in secret,
That bird that landed and made an impression,

That carried with her his name.

Baby Dragon
The wild ‚Äúone‚Äù came and went;
   Not under the bed, nor in the cupboard closet,
   But soaring from the mountain tops,
Across the horizon, o‚Äôer the melting sunset.
Leaving me perplexed and in wonder,
   For no creature should be as great as thunder,
   Yet, I could not deny this thing its place,
And for me, this gift from the heavens, a grace.
Shall I give it a name, like a pet diamond, yet treat it the same,
   O‚Äô, what a thrill to have a dragon that is tame,
   But the mere dragon is not, as I thought,
   Real beyond the mountain tops,
   Instead sleeps by our side; under the moonlit trees,
A thing is not.

A brush, a lush with Fate,
Contemplate the date,
Wh‚Äôere time is, ne‚Äôer late,
Thine feet are gone,
Thine heart is a song,
The path a bit short, and long,
Betwixt a kremson ruby eyed love,
A child with wings, a sharp tail to dispel,
Wild‚Äôere marks and ships sinking in the murk,
Wh‚Äôere aye embark tempest woe,
Under simple coat and dagger,
Eager for rain, shower and desire.
Keeper of dreams, a walk
Look, another brother, sister too,
Embrace what comes, mist and sun,
Wilt shines thru, skys and blanke tunes,
Inside a mind, quiet and inclined,
See single eyes in tears,
And, and, a stutter for you,
Who laugh--- a fool,
Etched blood thru a skin,
Written fibers pressed,
A noose, braided prison,
Ne‚Äôer, bring a new,
Yet curse ere tomb.
Wrath my heart consume,
Night becomes day,
As thine King slaves,
And whom chase ghostly mud pies,
Baron, little child, could play,
Toward the sun inside, a day darken
O‚Äôer empathy and shank‚Äôd homes,
Tied a fictitious book,
Victory, a end and sight broke loose,
O‚Äô the song, t‚Äôwas sung,
Beneath the berry brush and weeping trees,
Sleep, sleep, dream again and wilt wake.

O' penny in palm;
Less valued than a dollar;
But a damn near more full of soul,
If I gave it away to a seeker of like mind,
Or polish it so shiny -- Some never will find,
A true value lives with out reflection thereof,
Not only in Heaven, rather inside the heart, not the mind.
If I have a piece of wood, uncut and unblemished by hand, 
Would you be there too, in all your glory, dirt, and blues?
I'd surely hope in those footsteps of time; a quicksand at times;
And pass the buck with a cup full of shine,
If only to make it clear--- A toast to you: loving is what we do.

How are you so cute in thine eyes,
Standing there, in the crowd,
Such a fine specimen thou art,
A bit too shy; how thou mesmerize.
O' you had to stand out, 
How you found your way in such,
A bizarre world of lands apart,
From the bogs and dikes,
Makes me pucker up and write,
When your turn comes-- wings in flight,
A race toward the sky,
Or yet another mystery in time,
O' how I wonder-- pondering thy rhymes,
And seeth the disappearing from thee,
In quickness and spaceless ways,
A feeling I have not to capture,
In words yet to portray,
But the morrow is golden,
For another rainbow with you.

Kindling the reflections to change the theme,

And l o v i n g ... 'tis like marriage,

Moss
Feet firm in the ground,
A bit sluggish, but able to get around,
The grass isn't green o'er yonder,

All in a dazzle to aesthetically unwind,
And a few muses to the poet with his rhymes.

If I could look into your eyes that do not exist,
Yet see your other half glowing in radiance,
I'd think twice of why you are two, and not one,
Yet, you are one and not two,
For your other half is not even a shadow,
But a vacuum of emptiness which I see through.

I wonder, ponder, muse, and abuse,
The tender hypocrisy sold on a platter of chemical brain goo,
The monochrome dish serving human l o v e from a b o v e on the 9 o'clock news.
For dessert, a jubilee of spiritual books sold super cheap,
A couple of fruit flies too, and squish them between the teeth.
Exit the powder room in a hurry, the 11 o'clock news is sure to be different than early,
Channel flipping is a divine paradigm, as is ripping off that chemical goo that makes you shine.
Friendly fire, reloading this battle tank,
Aiming for that bullseye shaped like a holy spirit flake,
Boom!  -- Next channel.

For every word is a gesture to the soul,
As no soul is truly alone,
Tho if this soul claims 'tis mine,
What good will it do in time?
For time will wash away,
All rules made to stay.

The world is unnecessarily "woke",
And needs a good dose of therozine to cope.

Hello, old friend ; where have thy been?
Books and pens stolen you from thee?
No, Sir -- My time is a gift ; for you,
Not ‚Äòtis the other souls that claw at the doors of perception,
When you are Home and alive with me,
For I am a jealous conspiracy!
And I want you more than the deep blue seas, and
To hold the moon and stars together!
Shhh, in a whisper or whisker or whiskey -- maybe,
Just maybe, 
You‚Äôll be sublime without me -- Until the clock chimes three.

A Silly Putty Universe,
Is sure to make you squirmess!
A creak and a twirl of little universal draino,
Keeps the monsters at bay, or so you say!
   Where do they all go when the walls unfold?
   Do they travel, or sleep, do they even have a heart beat?
A kinder answer sir, has lost many souls at the door,
Tho if you know, ‚Äòtis you forget, in this case, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs both!
But under a stick and a stone, you reflect a dandier introspect,
Monophobia isn‚Äôt really a problem until the cows come home.
   Okay, okay then! By all accounts I think you win,
   My compass is surely to surpass this; little mess.
   And of course, take will I all the credit,
   For I really dread the debt ; ; sigh!
Buy me please, I am free, -- Quasi Mystery

WHO ARE YOU AGAIN
Sitting in the auditorium under the moonlit dome,
Musing at the colorful forms whilst I roam,
Minding my own business; yo, enjoying the show,
From out of the crowd a voice whispers something, 
Something quiet maddening:
 -- You are going to die!
I choose to ignore the irking jolt of insanity,
So pardon me lassy as I make my way past you,
Not in the mood to play your fool.

Wishing Well
Beyond the realm of words I seek,
To soothe a transition from brute to meek,
To contemplate the depth and dangerous journey,
To teach a lesson for another in a hurry,
Might not slip and fall,
Into depths of dark and no light at all.
But the wishing well is no place for a child to play,
For momma isn‚Äôt around and to the bottom of the well he may stay,
‚ÄòTis a wishing well for adults they say, let the kids stay away.
Tho if momma was around, she‚Äôd watch him play,
Into the wishing well that child might not stay.

Spring
Another day in the ore of sunlight,
Where my thoughts extract the essence of God, 
And forgo the blisters and temptations.
Under the shady embow'd canopy of trees,
Where many roots thirst for an underground spring,
An uprooted daisy is gathered by the winds,
Springing seeds of thoughts again.
This time next year some will bloom,
And many will be ready to consume,
By the furry little creatures so happy,
Until tomorrow, where you may find me napping.

%

If seeing was believing,
Then may god restart the universe once more,
At a QT, in the woods, or in the back seat floor,
While I captian this ship and paint new floral colors evermore.

Thoughts choked,
Soul a slave,
No hope, no compass, nothing to save.
Justice is a nuance, history should echo promises,
But 10,000 years and we are still empty, empty, a wasteland of crosses.

A weight‚Äôd heart, down, down until
The plume of dust settles,
Eyes can see the river of blood
Down a hearts open‚Äôd scars,
And endless reign of blood,
Longing for a home,
Golden eyes that do not rhyme,
Peer and rotate out of time,
You are not you, who
I do not want to know,
A looker, a foolish woe‚Äôr,
A frighten child could you be,
Away, away, the morrow be gay.
Yay, all has gone,
Not even a whisper; once glimmer‚Äôd,
Fra la laa ; you‚Äôre a winner.

Some Thing Called Soul ( quick hack poetry )
Captivated by the dark and cramped corners,
The Illuminati stretch, bend, and contour,
Their hands stuck inside where no light shines,
And their heart breaks into tears and whine,
When green hits their ego ‚Äòtis a wild ride says their lingo,
A job not for the weak and feeble feet.
Out of the corner of a whisper was a word,
Brought peace between the brute and the unlearned,
What good deed; what quick and steady mind,
I ponder, have all the good friends died for you?
Racing in the dust before the open meadow,
Where faces plowed into rocks and teeth where still smiling,
To be alive he said, this was the ride of a lifetime.
This journey into the ego, he said in a book over yonder,
On the dusty shelf, ‚Äòtis is where you think,
Your soul resides not in a mind; but outward; go shine,
And get dirty while you're at it.
It is so easy to play ignorant especially when you don‚Äôt know,
The story you make is essentially your soul,
But to every story untold, will bloom like a rose,
Maybe not your time to bloom, or perhaps you‚Äôre out of tune,
Or perhaps you bloom in darkness, and sing
A sour note, where ears cringe and crackle to the noise and babble.
Either way, there is a place, perhaps not as round and smooth as,
A pretty white pearl, or as soft and sweet as a kitty in a towel,
But you do have something, albeit a loose screw and a few wrinkles,
And that is you.  Not another be.
A blowhard and a laugh sent the rest of the bunch out to lunch,
Or at least the local beer shop to stock up on food for lunch,
The tease was in bed, surely to spread a few bugs instead,
And how the heat felt so sinister and foolish,
Good thing this story went out with the flop, 
As most of them wasted memories do.

A Fresh Start
Where once was he a precious psychosis,
   That scream'd into the abyss of emptiness,
Only to find echoes he'd mistaken for happiness,
   Have vanished and gone somewhere afar.
To dream now in silence, and collect the broken members,
  Of dried up leaves that fall from the centre,
Whence the wind blows the leaves off the soul,
  Turning silence away; into sounds of toil.

%

It‚Äôs all dead, the romance of soothing friendships,
Instead, the twinkle in the sky,
Where there is no you or I,
But memories so far away,
Where my heart is always filled,
Any time, any day.

%

One Moment 
And when you come to this place in the mirror,
And see not just a single thought,
But behold for a second at 10 o'clock,
A second pair of eyes.
It is for a moment all too real,
But in the mirror the blink of eyes changes reals,
And the show carries on, one foot behind the other.

%

Force, that binding attraction,
Grows weaker as the gods gaze upon the action,
Jealously, a wanting phantom,
Keeps us from imploding together into cosmic atoms,
Until now, as the Sun is upon my fingertips,
And the Moon is upon thy lips,
I sing a sweet lie, and pretend 'tis this my love a God that is not,
But you O' sweet darling, 
Your Honey is so sweet and charming.

%

The dark universe is around the corner,
The brim and pastel rays too,
I step and non step and nothingness remains as true,
As true as reaching beyond the temporal lines drawn,
Where imagination here is not infinite and full,
But o'er yonder quite the surprise will be told.

Pouring o'er ice, distilled in age,
With a sip and wink the night fell upon us.

Politician
Capture a picture,
Of the warmth and kindness shining through,
This was the reflection in your eyes,
Which I covered in a cherry pie,
Because I see through all your lies.

A coat, a book, a lightning rod,
A digital savior without broken bones,
The tickle of purity, open your lips,
A baby is born, an old mother dies,
A prize for tho thru disguise,
And war freed your soul.

Action
I heard, but instead saw the music,
Shimmering in the twilight,
I felt, but instead heard all silent precepts,
Echoing o'vr and over, in endless delight,
So I picked up my six string and played,
And all my senses were as one, and say...

What is Crazy
What is crazy appears to me,
Appears to me you little Bee,
Flying all around on my door knob,

Difficult to muster the right grip on reality,

Safe Place
In your arms I giggle,
Scratch my head and wiggle,
Christ, you're not complex at all,
A spooky cavern with snakes that crawl,
Frogs chirp too, in case snakes were not enough for you.
A dark light, only at night, under the moon and stars so bright,
Christ, now you know,
Is simple and sweet, not a book yo.

%

I aspire to be a poet for just a day,
That fools in glitter in wonderous ways,
Here the puzzle takes root,
In steaming corridors where the sacred partook,
Came a sound of death: 
   Thrive O' Soul;  That dark storm whom calls our names,
   Will be nothing if we were all one,
   But to live forever we are, through the
   Magic of love.

Broken Lens
You should have seen the whispering band of bandits racing through the woods over the mountaintops in a fiery rage. 
You should have seen the queen on top of the mountain being held hostage by the misanthropes of childish endeavors. In time and time again that mysterious bubbling up carried my soul. 
You should have seen the phantom airplane dropping the cure over humanity. You should have seen how shaking I was, trembling all over, but there you were the savior, a spark of hope unbeknownst to what point as I was still all alone, or was I?
I try to heed to the calling, your calling. I broke my will, I've bent myself in all sorts of contortions and for just a moment I was free, free to be engulfed by your love, just to swim with you in your ocean. And for a second we were together at last.
To think we were together harmonizing the creation before us but in a flash, night took a turn and devilish attacks came pouring in.

Memory
I followed the cobwebs were the thicket blazed in search of the law,
I found a group of elders not worried about their age, very humble, and the opposite of tall.
When I approached them about the meanings of life and the place whench all had came,
They peered at me very cheerful and said--
"Look at the lad without his life. That what you seek is to be blamed. There is nothing new under you. Do you not see the river inside from whench all came? 'Tis that stream of desire to be alive.  She see's you all around in eminent design".
I see, replied the voice from within.  Must I uncover the heavens only once, ne'er to again peer over the mundane starry canvas?  Shall memory sustain once thirst of the rivers bares me dry? 
Replied one voice grasping a rose thorn but no sound was heard, only mumbles.
A child walked around from behind them and with a big frown said--
"Go home little spider, your webs are intwined! Do you not see your river to incline? Against the current you will go! Embodying the odds with a few woes.  
I closed my eyes and found myself.  That was All I needed I thought,
A few moments of clarity and a tip from the spirits be all I desired.  But the journey was just beginning.  An endless path in spirals and where it all ended? Where it all began?  Is there a master plan?  A few more minutes, and we'll be back here again.

Wake Up

The church bell rings on to empty pews,
The preacher and choir weary none,
Of the good lord and savior to come,
Sunday school is over ; time to play,
Is all that is on the minds today.

The Clown
Shadows cast upon the ground,
Forgoing pride of a clown,
Who's pride once a star to show,
Now fades a magic rainbow,
He prayed the day for more rain,
Not to wash away the pain,
But to drown the hellish sight,
Of the pride he clings so tight.

  meanwhile, the politician sings
  betwixt a charming heart we saw,

Baby bird, baby bird fly away today,
Momma is calling, come child this way,
Baby bird, baby bird you will find that worm,

Baby bird, baby bird you are all grown up and strong,
Momma taught you well, how to sing that song.

I could write about the pain and sorrows,
  Those doubts that fill the ear,
I could keep back my promises,
   To make tomorrow a day of cheers,
Why waste all my time on glome and despair,
    It will only make things worse in the end
 So I chose to make the best of the moment,
    And see the rainbow over and over again.

%

The Sun is out again,
The clouds are pink within,
The wind is softly blowing,
The trees gently bend,
The night is coming soon,
The stars might shine thru,
The dreams are slowly whirling,
In the bed made for you.

%

The eclipse of time was felt in the heart,
   Shattered pieces of glass ; a work of art,
Realizing the moment your ignorance was replaced,
   With careful luck or an alien Grace,
Inside the seed of universal black holes,
   Bouncing off the uncertainty made of arrows.
On the other side of time the seeds of mine,
   Swims around 'n around the ethearal sublime.

Mere Mortal--- O how you remember,
The long run inside the pathless heart,
Where I am not.
I'm a gemstone in you, ruby in hue,
As a token of me; I'm red as blood,
I speak in timeless fashion, brotherhood,
Some call me Brahma, some call me Jesus,
By many names I remain the same,
Abraxas was rather elegant but also insane,
If you need a map check with me again,
I'm always rational and mundane

Happy mother's day to you!
Wherever you are, the sky is always blue,
Even when you're not around,
Your love shines through.

A Cure From Death
I see the shadows, the silhouettes -- the gravity upon the particle nets,
The slow beating heart, my patience soon slips, 
The lessons taught in school, my eyelids oft wept,
To adjure a moral cusp, lacking ere-- 'tis the question,
To float upstream in nakedness, and now clothed in fashion.
Trust in the process, a lie to confess,
Beauty in thine eye, or a fine dress?

Treasure chest
In the lake of old, a treasure lies below,
Waiting to be ope', into waves of hope,
Many passerbys, under the wishful sky,
Carry a muse ; a tune ; a clue.
Carved on a tree, a heart and rose,
With a squirrely line, to and fro,
Jolting and racing, the quest to find,
The sunken treasure, deep in the mind.
Is it mine--all mine, this treasure before my eyes,
Indeed I say, heavenly breath is mine today.

%

Little Friday
All the days yet best to come,
'Tis the day we prepare,
To blast off in rays of fun.
Without a penny to our name,
Or a child to play our game,
A pathless story is what came,
Sparkeld in colors writ insane,
A voice mumbled beneath the grain,
Help me O love for today.
For today is a little morrow,
Kindled in fears that make us stronger,
Broken but not impossible, a laughter
So strong it shatters all that is wrong.

%

The capacity to understand infinity
Is only thru loss.
All else is just math.
A black hole from the start,
I'm the mind inside your heart,
The end is not a debate,
Everlasting, timeless, a void in space.

What's For Breakfast
In the midmorning hour, where the static of creation hums,
A lamp of iridescent thoughts begins to churn,
Slowly morphing and forming into consciousness, and threads of life begin to rise with a sense of fullness,
Midday comes and goes, with it the jobs done and missions controlled,
Not without a few aches and bumps, of course-- 'tis par for the course,
With the midnight eve upon us now,
Time is awasting, it's way passed happy hour.

(The Saint)
Not all storms come to an end,
Some get stronger like a bottle of gin,
Some even suit the soul better than a friend,
Some shine brighter with rain till the end.

(The Sinner)
Quick and easy that is the cure for the sinner,
Turn water into wine and a prayer before dinner,
Save a lost soul, a cat and an empty bowl,
A tree for the forest, a recycling center with a toil,
Jesus fuckin Christ, it's hard to be nice,
Esp in a poem that is half writ and broken.
Chalk it up as I swallow the pride one more time.
(The End)

I came alive -- alone with you,
By my side.

Found with each footprint,
A language never spoken
But felt in other ways -- a notion.

Time to play outside again,
   To frolic along the paths ere made,
Where no path d'ye ken,

Maybe not by fate or destiny,
   But sure I will try for goodness sake.

When The Words Are Blurred
It's hard to keep a faith,
It's hard to feel what's real,
When there is lacking in me,
The passion and thrill.
For many times long ago,
I felt in me a roar and thunder,
It cleared the air and fog,
And carried hopes and wonder.
Though now I feel a sense of slowness,
To the roar and thunder that once was-- Alas!
How I wish I could just be happy
In any situation, no matter a half empty glass.
A part of me accepts a role in the loss,
Bitter tears, anger -- I've delt,
But passion and love is so close to my heart,
It's what is, and seems endless from the start.

%

When Words Fail Me
Try as I might to get the science just right,
Digesting the numbers for a reason,
When harmony and symmetry were plainly insight, and with that came the seasons.
It wasn't without purpose, 
The pursuit of happiness to not be wrong,
A feeling of belonging like notes was I,
To the chariot whims of song.
In idle content I sit back more times now than I should,
Listening to the ever flowing chorus - Imagination on steroids, a piece of driftwood.
But when I do change the scene,
With a boyish fetish to seek a hidden spot,
I grab the tackle and bait, head to the lake,
And fish for a few till it's time to stop.

%

Timely Lies
You could say it was meant to be,
The perfect architect, the world bewixted thee.
In reality the silence is full with perfect senseless sensory.
A timely lie cloaked in freewill that is s-l-o-w-l-y expiring back into eternity.
Like a new born baby---two worlds colliding;
That of spirit and that of lies.
When a black hole is born, the show will go on,
And countless hours could be better spent,
On wondering why we are not alone,
Rather accepting her for her mystery,
Of ignorance we shall dispell our lost soul,
And ripen the treasures locked away behind our dreary.

%

Life Is Funny Like That
Plans for the morrow we all make,
A little effort with a guesstimate,
But alas when hours pass,
And our plans are still an unfinished task,
A voice cry's out to get'r'done,
And echoes back more hours please madam,
Tis not ready to maker happen.
You'll know soon enuff I promise,
I've got your name to my schedule book, er napkin,
And no doubt in a week, month or two will be progress,
And back to normal life with no mess.

Colors
Realign to the centre
Where a rainbow meets your mind,
Perfect conditions couldn't be splendor,
For all life entwined.
It's easy to pass the burden,
To cast out your enemy,
Once they are gone from hurt'n,
You see the allegory:
That all life falls into yays and nays,
Does and don'ts decreed as true
A ledger of morality to show the ways
Where the center of the rainbow is you

Wake Up
Silence is deafening
Yet no words need come from Her,
She is all but a blessing,
As she kills me softly and quietly,
My essence reposed and politely
Asleep.

Immortality
Enter into the world of contradiction,
    A circle must go round,
But who here knows which is pure fiction?
Where left necessitates right and right necessitates left,
   I‚Äôd wager all my money on that certainty,
Only to be clutching on to that treasure chest.
Is it then I grimmish more at this locked door,
    To be so close yet far away,
And hand you my keys because they don‚Äôt fit anymore.
Perhaps another page in this life will be turned,
    Out of pure necessity if my will desires,
To be is quite a mystery and a lesson learned.
Go then in all directions before the chapter ends,
    Make each day a little nicer if you can,
A story awaits for the next generation to make their mends.

Don't dream of me 
In the sleepy forest,
Kiss me on the lips
I will follow you

Farmer and the Bear
( An impromptu poem of a bear joke - clean version)
I saw you there, sleeping in the chair,
Dreaming of her wild ways,
Then came a bear with a tap on the back,
Better wake up jack, about time for my snack.
With that came a gun, two barrels to sum,
Aimed for the kill, but all that for no thrill,
As the bear was still there, not bothered but alas,
A little horny from all the ruckus.
The farmer tried a again and again,
To kill the bear that was too friendly for him,
With a rocket launcher to do the job. And
The smoke left with a big hole and a mess,
But the bear had a better plan.

Jesus in a Tux
Charming, laid-back with a Crux,
A message for the sloppy dressed,
The story of life is looking good to impress!
And the Penguin waking to the rising Sun,
That's your mission, be ready to take a plunge,
Wearing your fancy suit of armor, 
Dazzled from head to toe,
Brimming in all your glory,
Wherever the wind may blow.

The morning crow chuckles at us,
As our cascade of dreams soon fades;
We peer out into this new birth of worldly order,
And drank the lost drop of phantasy we made.
Something great is coming o'er the horizon,
A winding road untraveled in ages;
'Tis a moment for yet another dream,
For phantasy, aye?  I'll annie my wage.

%

Oh, what great burden to carry,
The stigma of a thousand fairies,
Shuttled and huddled away from the sun,
Into the dark abyss, into the omniscient one,
When the sun does arrive brimmed and divine,
This limp mortal coil will toil on,
Weathering the days and nights to come,
With or without you, and your righteous blues,
Friend or foe, nobody has a greater woe,
A greater friend in He, or She,
That reality, not this calamity.

%

The Spirit Is A Glorious Lie
Ears perk and harken to Her song,
The gravity of belonging thrushes me along,
I dance here, I dance there, 
I quiver in my choices sung thru the arye,
I rejoice and shun, 
I rolled a die and found the Sun,
On my own way I tell Her,
I will get along, but She doesn't care,
One way or another I'm just a pawn.

Paradigm Unshift
I walk the streets of gold
In the woods on an untold secret.
Where gems and sapphires crush beneath my feet, and
All I see is a perfect canopy.
Something about opposites,
And seeing the darkness,
Is oft the cliche.
Tho being when I'm near,
That perfect square,
I don't have any questions,
Worry nor fear.
And I know, from the frost on
My toes, that sunbeams don't always come
Year round. For if they would, my 
Perfect square might not be
As it should.

Plato's Cave
In the cave it's oh so quiet,
No yelling from the kids,
No banging nor riots.
In the cave it's oh so cool,
No sweat off the brow,
No dry mouth nor drool.
In the cave it's oh so peaceful,
Nothing to bother me,
Nothing to peeve nor dull.

Destination Space Station
I wanted to surprise you with a visit,
Your home was a space station albeit, 
My homing device was working just fine,
Zero gravity was tricky but I made it just in time.
You got there just as soon as me,
With a few guests to honor and please
And they brought kids that loved to fly
Too fast, nor listen to adults when chastised.
When the traffic officer finally caught us,
I was furious and mad as a hornet,
Tho he was kind and polite, 
He even knew some of the faces of kids to cite.
I was surprised at first,
But more surprised at the officer,
Who was frail and old, clothes in rags, skin and bones.  
Probably an alien in disguise,
Probing the universe for speed demons and crazy rides,
It brought back memories when I was earthbound,
When I had similar experiences to learn,
When both feet were firm on the ground.

I Called Out Your Name; You played A Game
I was searching for something,
Something to believe that would make it all true,
Something that would bring back memories to what I was supposed to do.
I wasn't sure of all the parts played out.
The wisdom and friendship found in adolescent eyes. I wasn't sure if anything but the journey was a bumpy ride.
Your voice was there following me around.  I sought your footsteps you left, covered in layers below the ground. Was I going in circles? A pointless endeavor to seek out clues?  Why make me believe? Why string me along? I will find you and when I do, best be ready to sing my song--
A myriad years of souls without faces will echo through you.  A tidal wave of universes will consume you.  And a child with a single face will bemuse you.  
We can do this together, as if there was a choice.
Both of us, a trillion facets, merging into one voice.  Another story, another clue. Endless points without a face to know who.  
An ending insight! Now that's a delight! But where to start this journey in the dark. In a dream a voice lingered, pulling me around like a lump of coal. Waging a battle inside a hungry soul.
Hungry indeed, was I.  A hundred and one of those tasty treats would I dine.  Can you be quiet, can you hear the sound of silence? When people stuff their faces with quicky bites and maggots?  
At least the flavor is real.  So you believe the spell. Over and o'er.  And in the morning light, you chase Her.  Repeating the story yet again.  Seeking something with an end.

%

Day Night
Daylight fades but I'm still
Pleased to cognitate,
I pretend to be asleep while
I roam the halls to noctambulate
The halls echo beautifully
Tho voices of somniloquoy
Higher lumens of sense from
A bioluminescence calling me.

%

Recovery
   Come to me O‚Äôfaithful one, sit by the fire,
Listen to the sounds of thunder in the midnite hour,
   The sound of a baby angel tucked in my arms,
The sound of love broke in two from eyes that harm,
   Down, down we go, in quicksilver steps,
Peace awaits the wanderer as he recalculates his frets,
   On a sunnier inclination in a dreamless turn,
Words become actions poised and firm,
   Kiss me once more, forever is gone,
Just a reminder thrown against the dawn,
   Now is forever, wherever I belong.

%

High Expectations
A happy memory to share,
  A clumsy meaning;
Each of us pretending
  Never to never care.
I expected you here too,
  Atop of the mountain
Perfected in wonder,
  At a life we had forgotten.
And then it came upon me,
  As a dove,
To cherish something
  Less understood.
In a letter wrote
  Signed by the Heavens-- 
"Love one another
   'Tis all my friend."

On A Little Rock...
   'n Chair
In space, amongst the stars,
That reach till infinite spans,
I sit in my rock 'n chair, wondering,
Pondering, waiting to understand.
The feeling of something,
I don't know where to begin,
Floating around in this big space,
While rocking in my rock 'n chair again.
I remind myself it is not a dream,
As real as it may seem, 
To feel what-- I don't know,
Just here on this rock 'n chair,
Waiting for the stars to say hello.

%

Thinking of you
Thinking of you again,
With your leather laced docs,
And your tattoo'd skin.
With those eyes that penetrate,
Through the bullshit,
Like a strong hurricane packed into a pretty face,
A few scares never sacred you away.
A force to be reckoned with,
Oh my God, was a I fool,
To have not listened to you,
Maybe it was the angel in your voice,
That swept me off my feet,
Or the inkling in my mind,
That believed.

%

Those colors
Then suddenly a sharp pin prickle of a sound 
Softly jingles,  
I mosey around and acquaint myself,
And fall in love with the colors,
Spinning all around.
Propelled from there my senses stumble,
Thinking and breathing so naturally 
I just want a taste, something to savor.
As I can't get you out of my mind

%

Enlightenment
The world outside is clumsy,
It bumps into you when you're least expecting,
It drops, breaks, and goofs up quite readily,
Lessons learned via meditating.

%

I saw the pain in your eyes
My bright Morning Star
As you looked away
A tiny bit of sweet essence
Plucked in the midnite sky
So fragile, so Divine.
Your love is scattered all around,
In throngs of chorus sung in sound
Not in hate and violent corridors
Nor in phantom monsters underground
Their is no name for her shadow
Endless darkness : endless tales.

%

Oh It's You
I saw you outside,
Aye, a bit surprised,
As you had no disguise.
Simple and elegant
Steadfast and poised,
Off like thunder,
To the shopee with pride.
I sat in awe, as I'm a fan,
To see you not as a star,
But a simple man.

Life Happens
We are the only known species to question it. 
Instead, learn to listen to the unspeakable language it provides daily.

Validation
In the presence of a flower, a tree,
The comforting breeze,
A pattern, a resonance, a sufficient
Reason for elegance,
Emerges, emanates like crystal clear rain.
To put not me to rest but in eager restless
Pursuit to wonder.
To which upon the mountain top I see a valley,
It is there, free from the certainty and ideals, 
That foolish adult whom never tasted the fruits of Her order.
Neither inhaled the soot, the flame,
That burns.
It is there I want, I see my reflection growing
In all directions...

%

A galaxy is born and a tiny drop
Of water finds it's way out of her world,
And lands somewhere like a womb,
In a sea of darkness and dreams.
Can you feel yourself think?
   Can you think you'd feel?
When words fail to capture,
   A time that was real,
Time, that passing engine,
   Upon each breath I take, 
A star is born,
   While another shines dissipate.

Here a tease to writ heir Muse,
Lost, perplexed but stood,
Chilled memories on an ice cube,
Penetrating exothermic hieroglyphs I felt,
Touching my soul in e‚Äôeree semiotic steps,
Oh how thine year's grew in dharma.
Whilst now a second seem so long,
Looth heir tempest soma.

Down the synaptic pathways,
A seemingly solo rollercoaster ride,
Sped me across a few faces,
And soon I was by her side.
Sitting together on a cozy worn-out leather couch,
Ready to unravel what ever came to mind,
While everyone else slept away their dreams,
We were beginning ours-- feet stretched out.
She was more than an Angel, more than a Goddess,
A hybrid some would call her, 
But honestly, She was just a lover, a talker, 
A wanderer--waiting for me in my dreams --
I guess.

The Doctor
The Doctor who said it was his time,
By the name of the patient in his mind,
By next month -- Sir he replied, -- I'll be over yonder, In those mountains, so high up ; ready to decline.
With my single speed I'll go, trailing my youth in old,  Forgetting 9-5 and all those years I toiled.

In the shadows of the heart,
From whoms light a simpler soul,
Peered magnitude and quantity,
   A ratio.
In the monad was apperception,
Of which is and is not, 
Just as the day exhales the night,
   Its place is of naught
But in the retro descending whirlpool 
Tiny Gods await, 
With mulitiudes of mystery and science,
   Which no calculator could perfect

My Soul
Time reveals the mystery,
One day at a time,
In the magic of sleep,
Where souls come alive.
And I watched my soul float away,
As another filled its place,
Whom I was now was a bigger mystery,
There was no I, just a foreign face.
And I listened,
As others spoke of God,
Searching for meaning behind it all,
And the spirit whom had me enthralled,
Was taking the show,
It had other plans for me,
Alas, I had to let it go,
And return to myself,
My soul.

%

E pluribus unum
I believed in the many,
But settled for one step at a time,
With one hand full;
The other kept by my side.
And soul is the same,
In part filled to the brim,
The mind being opened and free
Ready to embrace every possiblity.

Life Is Funny Like That
Plans for the morrow we all make,
A little effort with a guesstimate,
But alas when the day has passed
And our plans are still an unfinished task,
A voice cry's out to get'r'done
With another whiskey sour please madam!
Tis not ready to maker happen.
You'll know soon enuff I promise,
I've got my life all planned,
Written on this here napkin.

The sky's are cool and mist is in the air.
The president of the universe,
In his shimmering mind,
Gazed upon his creation though could not help to find,
The intricate reason to why his soul is divine,
Surely no other would come before him,
In waves of logic his numbers would surprise,
Though they would not add up to his forgetting the disguise,
Of a universe he created all alone,
Without help from no one, not even a son.
But a daughter, She told it all in her glory
To shake and rattle his ego home,
Loosen that nook you call a book,
And taste a thirst of a beloved life from unknown realms,
Enlighten your days that wisdom Sophia will show you a way,
By faith Pistis in the unknown worlds you ne'er shall spell.

Thoughts and Stuff
When will I learn the way,
To quiet the inner voice,
To live as full as a rose in June,
To be unlearned as a child in school.
Give me peace, give me hope,
Give me a world not occupied by ghosts,
Give me wings to fly, courage to cry,
A little pride, and a desire to thrive.
Then and there between thin ice,
The one sided dice of life,
Where I walk to and fro, tumbling to show
A clever explanation, for the lost situation,
A lack of judgment, brought on and fueled by nothing coherent.
But alas, in recognition of the past,
In a light shining not straight,
But forward in a rounded sort of way,
The possibilities; the ominous and infinite betwixt and single; mingle in these clunky clothes I wear.
And love, what of such a bond,
A fleeting unity felt for eternity,
On the mundane archetypes,
But alas, a real love from above,
In raging storms at night,
To the radiant sunbeams across the endless sky,
The twinkle of a star or two,
The gift of waking up anew, awaits
No more, but is here in a quiet shy
Kindred and humbled smile from 
An old photo album in my mind,
Where you grow old and wise,
Teaching the young how to survive.

Unreason
Mocking authority 
Treated unfair,
Along side company 
That loved his ways,
But it was not without
Courage
When ready, fate would chime in
And so it did.

Healing
My mind is alive,
Filled with thoughts that speak of love,
In quiet repose and memory
I learn when I fall and rise above,
My heart is filled with passion,
A meek sincerity for others
To grow stronger in reason and judgment,
In all ways possible now and forever.
My soul is bigger than me,
Sometimes I'm a devil between the deep blue sea,
Tho that may be, and oft I ignore the mess,
I forgive and heal, and look at the morrow to be my best.

Unreal
We flew into each other
The magical colors
And God gave it Game a spirit
And competition, and from Her
Birth came life and death
But time is real, where I hear,
And sense and taste imagination,
In dreams and in the unreal.

Please bring all your children to our wedding.

Words between us,
Thoughts stuck to static vibrations,
Magical stories writ thru our souls,
And in time comes inclinations.
To embrace and climb thro the story,
To wink at the mirror of time,
To throw ourselves together,
In perfect other worldly rhymes.

A little happy thought
Broke into a million parts
With sharp edges that may bleed the heart
And may also put together a path some need to walk
Tho some may need to run, and some some may need to fly
Others may need nothing at all but a friend to listen while they cry.

Want to hear something trippy?
Want to hear it again?

Standing by a tree.
Sometimes it hears you,
Singing to that jubilee.

and it said.... It's not here or there but the time you spend looking.

Can grasp what no one else sees

And lost in the dark like a shadow behind a mirror?
Would you sit or lay beside me and kiss the world as we sail away?

In the forest Mother speaks,
  Whilest threads of gold and pink;
And all the while Father away in dark,
I hear the ageless wisdom bark,
Not loud and ruff, nor vicious and naughty,
  But quality.  
And in a fever of restless passion,
  Where quality meets and greets my pen,
I find some imagination to spare,
From which I dropped out of thin air,
A breath of fresh fueled with despair,
   Of quantity.
Yes, that is the rub, only a few will beat to the drum,
  And thy pen is my sword.
And in myth and story tis shall suffice,
When better than a dagger in the night.

All the while in labor and trials
  Comes a notion or an imaginary token,
That disappears just as soon as it appears,
And while the truth of nothingness is rather
Full and empty, and all together,
Likewise is neither and just a magic that lingers
On into the next time.
And the next time, and the next time, and the next time.
  Wondering and pondering.
Tis fine as an old dusty bottle of wine.
Tis fine as an clumsy clown trying to shine.
Tis fine as a tattoo on the snake that bites.

The Evil One Repents
Time embraced me betwixt meaning and yearning,
And how the spirit filled the path I made,
Borrowing an Oath not to be human,
I soar‚Äôd and saw my trapped heart thirsting for life,
And how the spirit savored my death,
And cleansed its face upon my strong shoulders,
We became as one in a dream, that ne‚Äôer slept,
Oh how the spirit open‚Äôd the world to me and said
     Here I am, 
     In front of you!
Softly I listen‚Äôd to the fullness and emptiness,
Always questioning myself and the others who sleep 
with eyes like me.
Always questioning togetherness -- That beautiful death that will come. 
With double vision my home is incomplete and looks to be free,
And how the spirit tried to pretend to be my home,
That ere no book could contain. 
Thou the spirit wanted more -- all of humanity!
Only to see the reflection of the evil one which said:
    Bend the light into heaven,
    Heaven will grow and make room.
And the spirit grew nowhere,
My path went nowhere,
In this flight of ego, I became,
I saw the end of the tunnel,
Wrapped in a reef of death,
Where warriors stood.
Longing for the secret all around them
If only the dense fog didn‚Äôt surround them.
Their ship might sail east always toward the Sun.
And out of the darkness came a creature with silver eyes,
   That fought with this evil and battled a war,
   Heaven went away to the sidelines to watch as the dust flew,
Blood and shrapnel scattered every where,
The creatures finely saw themselves in a war between their own children,
Their own family and friends.  They retreated and cried and mourned,
Instead of shedding blood they shed tears.
Over the mountain tops stilled a setting lake,
  There between the fog and crokes,
Rises the wisdom.

Hear the noise from the crowd of hounds,
Heaer them again and turn that frown upside down.

shot!

Nothing was, and nothing went,
Thru the trees and past the tents,
Over and under kissing an Oath,
Over countless other Oaths,
And the fingers are numb from 
All the lack of a single idea,
That was ne'er seen nor heard from dis ear,
And a cup now is empty, with
Half a drop of hope,
In tomorrow;  perhaps a sailing boat.
She said with a smile, come be with me a while,
And a gust of wind blew by
Past the tearing moon in the sky,
All the while, thoughts pervade
   Where am I to calm this rage,
Four tigers leaped, and dragons eat,
With fire and death on hearts that ne'er beat,
Nor eyes that fear the cage nor tears.
And beyond and in front a hollow hut,
To keep secrets sacred was lost like a slut,
It was what it was, a wisdom tooth expelled,
A wishful hope that healing could go beyond the veil,
But here in this cell, with keyboard and ringing bells,
Time melts into a blissful capsule that makes me well.
And what of letting go of those flowers in the cupboard
  That have teased the heart of many a fool,
Was it real or just a spoon full of a game that pays very well.
Neither nor, nor could I wish to know--
All I wanted was the answer for a better girl.
Was it possible to think, and yes drunken  from love,
A taunting maze of simply.
And now if you see her disappear,  it may sting and burn for a while,
Lady Freedom comes a knocking, we should honor that for a while.
Damned and shamed, ridiculed and called insane,
Sleeping in a dream I just can't seem to tame.
But know you this, it was and still a joy.
To pretend for awhile, a 4 star letter was in my heart for a while,
Which is now wounded and exposed like a child.
Tis is why no fucks are given, when your heart is in the right place.

Many times I've wondered 
About the book of love,
Pages often scrolled,
Lifting hearts above.
Many times I screamed,
At that nonsensical verbiage,
Thrust'd down the throats
With nothing good but hurting.

And your fate is just a rubber-band,
You take a few pieces of what matters most,
And go understand

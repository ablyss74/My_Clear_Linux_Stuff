Oringally the c code was written by someone else for "fortune", a command line program that randomly reads fortunes from a file.
<br><br>
I modified it to be more user friendly:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the fortune.dat data file to poems.txt which makes it easier to edit with a GUI app,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also changed the data separator from I think a hashtag, to a percent sign. I found this better for my poems.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a hashtag works better for you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also changed path location to a current working path which is also easier to work with.<br>

Poems written by all by me.

To compile just enter the directory and type `gcc ./poems.c -o poems`
